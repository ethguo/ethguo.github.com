**Founder/Lead Organizer of JAMHacks**

[JAMHacks](http://jamhacks.ca/) was Waterloo's first high school hackathon, organized by high school students. Our aim is to expose more high schoolers to the hackathon community and inspire them to pursue more creative, innovative projects and careers in technology. On April 9th, 2017, over 100 students from as far as Windsor, Toronto and Mississauga came out for our first 12 hour event!

## Recent Projects

### LEAP
[Repo](https://github.com/foleyfactor/LEAP) | [Devpost](http://devpost.com/software/leap-leapmotion-emulating-android-project) | *Hack the North 2016*

Anyone who has seen a Leap Motion before will know how cool the devices are, yet not many people seem to actually own one. What if there was a way for us to bring the Leap Motion experience to anyone with a mobile phone?
LEAP (Leap-Motion Emulating Android Project) is an Android app that uses your phone's front-facing camera to sense hand gestures, and sends them to your computer in real time to control whatever app you want. For example, you can simply swipe left or right in mid-air to `Alt-Tab` and `Alt-Shift-Tab`.

### CheqOut
[Repo](https://github.com/foleyfactor/CheqOut) | [Devpost](http://devpost.com/software/cheqout) | *MasseyHacks II*

Cheqout expedites the process of waiting in line at stores: simply scan the products with your smartphone and pay through the app once you're done. On your way out, show the generated receipt to an attendant (Costco style) and enjoy the precious time you saved.

### WordSENSEI

[Repo](https://github.com/ethguo/wordsensei) | [Report](https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2015/46aa6e0f2cb183f8330dd571a93d279e96fe24841fa8404ccd749684df98e37a) | *Google Science Fair*

WordSENSEI is a set of algorithms for word sense disambiguation, a subtask of natural language processing (NLP). Word sense disambiguation is the task of determining the sense of an ambiguous word (a word with multiple senses, like "bank" or "fine") within a sentence. Our system is unique in that it uses Wikipedia as its corpus (dictionary). You can read more at the report linked above.

### XPify

[Repo](https://github.com/ethguo/xpify)

(In need of a better name)

XPify is a web application to "gamify" classroom learning. Gamification is "the application of typical elements of game playing (e.g., point scoring, competition with others, rules of play) to other areas of activity" (Google), and XPify will use a point-based system to reward students for completing "challenges" defined by the teacher.
