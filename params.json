On your way out, show the generated receipt to an attendant (Costco style) and enjoy the precious time you saved.\r\n\r\n## Older Projects\r\n### WordSENSEI\r\n\r\n[Repo](https://github.com/ethguo/wordsensei) | [Report](https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2015/46aa6e0f2cb183f8330dd571a93d279e96fe24841fa8404ccd749684df98e37a)\r\n\r\nWordSENSEI is a set of algorithms for word sense disambiguation (WSD), an ongoing problem in natural language processing (NLP). WSD is the task of determining the sense of an ambiguous word (a word with multiple senses, like \"bank\" or \"mouse\") within a sentence. Our system is unique in that it uses Wikipedia as its corpus (dictionary). You can read more at the report linked above.\r\n\r\n### XPify\r\n\r\n[Repo](https://github.com/ethguo/xpify)\r\n\r\n(In need of a better name)\r\n\r\nXPify is a web application to \"gamify\" classroom learning. Gamification is \"the application of typical elements of game playing (e.g., point scoring, competition with others, rules of play) to other areas of activity\" (Google), and XPify will use a point-based system to reward students for completing \"challenges\" defined by the teacher.",
